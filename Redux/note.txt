redux is a predictable state container for js apps


react-redux:


3 core concepts:
store- which holds state of your applicattion
action-describes the changes in state of the applicattion
reducer which actually carries out the state transition depending on the action.

3 priciples of redux:
1st principle:
the state of your applicattion is stored in an object tree within a single stoore"
2:
the only way to change the state is to emit an action , an object describing what happened.
3:

to specify how the state tree is transformed by actions , you write pure reducers

redux store:

holds applicattion state
allows access to state via getstate()
allows state to be updated dispatch(action)
registers listeners via subsccribe(listener)
handles registreing of listeners via function returned by subsccribe(listener)
